TwitterWidgets
==============
These are three Twitter Widget.

1) The first one will display the searched tweets in a normal scroll down list.

2) The second one will display the Tweets one at a time; the user can scroll up or down using the arrows.

3) The third widget adds google-maps functionality to the second one, displaying the searched tweet on the map (it uses    the basic google geocoder).

For this project I used https://github.com/ricardoper/TwitterOAuth to get the tweets.

Basic Use:
==============

In the example folder the three widget are all build ready to work. Insert in the define.php file in the php folder your twitter api keys and you'll be ready to go.

In the other folders you'll find all the assets and scripts for each twitter widget. Same as before insert your keys in the define.php file.
